# tweet-map
A heat map of tweet activity around the world

# What is this?

I have been following the Barcelona Football team ever since I started playing football. I wanted to see how much 
support they garner around the world on twitter. So I built a tool to visualize it.

# TO DO

1. Some cleaning up to do, especially in the preprocessing stages.
2. Need to mine more tweets!
3. Need to find a way to upload plotly's original interactive map. ( It's pretty awesome )
